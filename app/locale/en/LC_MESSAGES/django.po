"<p>\n"
"    Transfr is a simple file sharing application developped in house at "
"Centdessin Design. The first goal was to make the process of sharing files "
"securely as easy as possible for our graphic designers and our clients.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"    After years of using the FTP protocol to transfer files between our "
"graphic designers and clients we got tired of the recurrents problems that "
"can't be fixed with FTP.\n"
"</p>\n"
"    The most significative ones being firewalls and clients that don't know "
"how to use a FTP.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"    In the process of building the application we decided that it could be a "
"nice idea to release it under Open Source license. It allow us to showcase "
"the quality of the web applications we build while, hopefully, being useful "
"to other people. We also think it's a great opportunity to increase the "
"quality of our software with user contributed fixes and enhancements, or at "
"least bug reports.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"    We also hope that it can somehow incite some of our clients to invest in "
"Open Source projects. It's our way to demonstrate that we truely believe in "
"the Open Source potential by not only using it, but proactively "
"contributing.\n"
